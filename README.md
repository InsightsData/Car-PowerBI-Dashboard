Incentive
-
1. What are the relationships between Price – Fuel Efficiency and Price – Horsepower?
2. How does Fuel Efficiency or Horsepower influence the Price?
3. What are the most expensive/fuel-efficient/fuel-consuming/with the largest/lowest horsepower /price cars?
4. What are the features of the top 5 fuel-efficient cars?
5. What are the features of cars with the top 5 largest horsepower?
6. What are the features of most expensive cars?
7. Which car suits me the best?

Result
-
1. The price increases as the horsepower gets larger;
2. The price decreases when the fuel efficiency increases over 26;
3. Features of the top 5 fuel-efficient cars (Fuel Efficiency: 33 - 45): Price and Horsepower are below the overall average;
4. Features of cars with the top 5 largest horsepower (Horsepower: 30.2 - 45): Both Price and Fuel efficiency are above the average;
5. Features of the most expensive cars (Price: 70 - 86): The Horsepower is above the overall average, but the Fuel Efficiency is under the average;
6. The most expensive (Price: 86) car: Mercedes-B CL 500;
7. The cheapest (Price: 9) car: Chevrolet Metro;
8. The most fuel-efficient (Fuel Efficiency: 45) car: Chevrolet Metro;
9. The most fuel-consuming (Fuel Efficiency: 15) car: Cadillac Escalade/Dodge Ram Wagon/Lexus LX470/Lincoln Navigator/Toyota Land Cruiser;
10. The car with the largest horsepower (45): Dodge Viper;
11. The car with the lowest horsepower (5.5): Chevrolet Metro;
12. Toyota Corolla suits me the best.

Suggestion
-
1. Focus on high Fuel Efficiency and low Horsepower if we want to buy a car with a good price.
2. Factors like car models may also influence the price.
